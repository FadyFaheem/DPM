  # the same outcome) and may spawn a time-limited ActiveEffect that throttles a
  # farm's output or a habitat's comfort. The roll watermark (last_event_roll_at)
  # advances by whole game-days like FoodCollection, so repeated reads inside one
  # game-day never re-roll. Expired effects are swept on every read.
